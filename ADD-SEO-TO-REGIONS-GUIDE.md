## Step-by-Step Instructions (2 Minutes)

### 1. Login to Strapi Admin
Go to: `https://mintdealsbackend-production.up.railway.app/admin`

### 2. Open Content-Type Builder
- Look at the left sidebar
- Click on **"Content-Type Builder"** (it has a puzzle piece icon 🧩)

### 3. Select Region
- Under **"Collection Types"** section
- Click on **"Region"**

### 4. Add SEO Field
- Click the **"Add another field"** button (blue button on the right)

### 5. Choose Component Type
- Click on **"Component"** (it should show as one of the field type options)

### 6. Configure the Field
You'll see a form with several options:

**Name:** Type `seo` (all lowercase - important!)

**Select a component:**
- Click the dropdown
- Select **"seo.meta"** (this is the same SEO component used by Categories and Stores)

**Type:**
- Select **"Single component"** (not repeatable)

### 7. Save Everything
- Click **"Finish"** button
- Click **"Save"** button (top right corner)
- A dialog will appear asking to restart the server
- Click **"Yes, restart server"**

### 8. Wait for Restart
- Strapi will restart (takes 10-30 seconds)
- You'll see a loading screen
- Once done, you'll be back at the admin panel

### 9. Run the SEO Population Script
Now that Regions have the SEO field, run:

```bash
node populate-seo.js
```

This will populate all 9 regions with SEO metadata!

## Visual Reference

```
Content-Type Builder
├── Collection Types
│   ├── Category (has seo field ✅)
│   ├── Store (has seo field ✅)
│   └── Region (needs seo field ❌)
```

**After adding:**
```
Region Fields:
├── name
├── parent_regions
├── region_type
├── timezone
├── geoArea
├── stores
├── Image
└── seo ← YOU'RE ADDING THIS!
    ├── metaTitle
    ├── metaDescription
    ├── keywords
    ├── metaRobots
    └── structuredData
```

## Troubleshooting

### "I don't see seo.meta component"
If you don't see `seo.meta` in the component dropdown:
1. Check Categories - they should have SEO field
2. Look in Components section of Content-Type Builder
3. There should be a "seo" category with "meta" component

### "Save button is grayed out"
- Make sure you entered the field name as `seo` (lowercase)
- Make sure you selected `seo.meta` component
- Make sure you clicked "Finish" first

### "Server restart failed"
- Check your Railway/hosting dashboard
- The server should auto-restart
- If not, manually restart the Strapi service

## After Adding SEO Field

Once the SEO field is added and server has restarted:

1. Run: `node populate-seo.js`
2. Wait for completion (about 30 seconds)
3. Verify in Strapi: Content Manager > Regions > Arizona
4. You should see the SEO section with metaTitle and metaDescription filled in!

## Expected Results

After running the script:
- ✅ 10 Categories with SEO
- ✅ 25 Stores with SEO
- ✅ 9 Regions with SEO
- **Total: 44 pages with professional SEO metadata!**
